					<p>My interest in IT spans back to my childhood. Back in the day it was dial up internet and waiting 5 minutes for a simple image to load was truly painful. Much later I was introduced to two sites called YouTube and Newgrounds, the fact that I had access to limitless content truly shook my world and showed me all the potential for creativity and the countless types of platforms that awaited me. After finishing high school and a Cert III in business I found myself working in a small family owned retail store where one of my many duties was general IT. This showed me just how much I enjoyed IT as a source of work and started to pursue an education.      <br><br>

					I knew that an online course was optimal for my learning style and am very grateful to have these resources available to me through Open Universities and RMIT. Looking into RMIT as a university, I was impressed by how highly regarded it was within the IT industry and found the extensive support and services attached to online studying made it an easy transition into studying again.     </p>

					My main goal is for my study path to lead me into a fruitful career and just what career do I find myself looking for the most? Ethical hacking and security. This job found on Seek is just one example of the many Ethical hacking jobs being advertised every day. 
					</p>

					<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/41087333?type=standout#searchRequestToken=f2db07f9-2cf9-496a-a70a-67a8a079e8e3 " target=_blank>Job Link </a>
					<img src="https://daym977.github.io/MattProfile.github.io/JOB.png" alt="Job Description">
					<p>This job is for a Senior Penetration Analysis and therefore comes with many responsibilities. The key aspects of the job are helping ensure clients internet safety by not only assisting with the upkeep of systems already implemented by the company but also to help integrate new systems into the company. <br> <br>  

						This job covers a variety of different areas of IT and therefore requires extensive skills and experience especially since it is a senior position. It is already a prerequisite to have at least 4 years in a similar position but to also hold a bachelor's degree in a relevant profession. The necessary proficiency skills required for this job may vary but the essential experience is having an solid understanding in programming languages such as Python, Ruby and JavaScript as well as an in-depth knowledge of popular operating systems such as Microsoft and Linux and knowledge of concepts in multiple security variations.    <br> <br>  

					Right now, my abilities are far from ready to tackle this job but that’s what goals are for. My current skillset encompasses a rather basic understanding of two programming languages, JavaScript and Python, and only a surface understanding of what goes into cyber security but I’m looking forward to using my degree to help build on all aspects of IT. I also have hopes to pursue a postgraduate degree in cyber security as it is a major interest for me and my career path.  </p>

					<h1>Who Am I?</h1>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>After undergoing three online personality test, I have done some reflection on what these results mean to me. The first test conducted was the iconic Myer Briggs <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/" target=_blank>test </a>. The results are in and my personality type has come back as INFJ-T, but what does this mean? Essentially this describes me as introverted, intuitive, feeling and judging strongly based on morals. Breaking this down it’s believed that INFJ people are meant to be introverted idealists with strong moral standards. I think this is a rather accurate reflection of my character of all the tests I took, as I have always been rather introverted and no matter the consequences I stick to what I believe is right.   </p>

					<img src="https://daym977.github.io/MattProfile.github.io/mind%20style.PNG" alt="Myer Briggs Personality">

					<p>The second test undertaken was the big five personality <a href="https://www.truity.com/personality-test/17315/test-results/16862546" target=_blank>test </a>. which breaks my score down into five dimensions of personality: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism. The breakdown is quite clear and heavily favours agreeableness and neuroticism. Both typically go hand in hand, the neuroticism tends to show people who hold themselves to strong morals and think strongly with their feelings and high agreeableness tends to mean that these people tend to help others rather than help themselves. These tests results are rather varied in accuracies, I can easily agree with the high agreeableness and high neuroticism and even the low extraversion, but the openness and conscientiousness should be far lower. </p>

					<img src="https://daym977.github.io/MattProfile.github.io/big5OCEAN.png" alt="Learning Style">

					<p>The last test I took was the learning styles <a href="http://www.emtrain.eu/learning-styles/" target=_blank>test </a>. This test developed based on the Honey and Mumford thought on study types. They believed there was four main learning types; Reflector, Theorist, Pragmatist and Activist. This test gave some rather all rounding results with low of activist and higher in reflector and theorist. A reflector is someone who takes their time to process information and makes decisions based on knowledge as opposed to making hasty or irrational choices.  The theorist is similar and approaches problems in a logical manner and value rationality and objectivity highly. Much like the first test, I wholeheartedly agree these results are a great reflection of my character.
					   </p>

					<img src="https://daym977.github.io/MattProfile.github.io/learningStylesPieChart.png" alt="Learning Style">

					<p>These results display a clear personality of someone who is rather introverted and quiet, not because they are shy but because they’re standing back and processing the information around them. A person with these personality traits demonstrates the ability to work well with more outgoing, outspoken people as they’re willing to accept and discuss ideas rather than work with other introverted people who might be more reserved.  </p>

					<h1>The Big Idea</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="sectionContent ">

					
					<p>For my project, I wanted to target the lack of interaction students get outside of school and help foster independent study with more access to resources. The idea is to build a chat bot to act as the student’s personal assistant/mentor. With the school’s assistance, the bot will be able to help students by providing resources to cover all topics that are currently studying and aid with assignments or projects. The bot will also have a personalised element of setting study reminders to make it more engaging with the student. </p>

						</font>
					</p>

					<p>
						Studies have shown that subjects like math, science and English scores are at a new low, and this is sadly due to one major cause. Results have shown that students are falling behind due to the increased amount of anxiety and lack of creativity that makes learning fun (Duffy and Wylie, 2019). I believe that the bot will help provide a more engaging way to receive information, utilise resources and keep students on track with learning goals to hopefully improve test scores.  
					</p>
					<p>
						The core concept behind this is to give each student a fully functional personal assistant and this can be achieved by a few easy steps. Firstly, each student will be given a login where they will fill out basic information about themselves such as age, name, hobbies, which the bot will later use in basic chat to form an alluring personal experience with the student. 
					</p>
					<p>
						A calendar for the current study period will also be programmed into the bot with data to help stay on top of their schedule. Information such as assignment due dates, exam timetable and class schedules will all be implemented by the school beforehand; this will help the student easily keep on top of their workload. The student will also have the freedom to add important information to the calendar such as goals and objectives for their study to ensure that their own personal goals are met alongside goals set by the school. The calendar can be requested for viewing at any time. The bot will also give prompts to the student concerning upcoming items on the calendar to help keep the student on track with their current study and personal goals.  
					</p>
					<p>
						Another key feature is the ability to bring up relevant study information. Too often students find themselves struggling to find resources relevant to their core content so with the help of teachers and schools, the bot can be programmed with applicable study material. This would need to be integrated by the school systems and personally by teachers to help hand pick exactly the information they want the student to learn. This can be requested by students with commands like “I need help with math” and the bot will bring up resources relevant to what the student is studying in class.  


					</p>
					<p>
						An important aspect of teen education is making students aware of themselves and their emotions. Self-expression is crucial for a student to relieve many forms of emotional distress and often goes unnoticed or unattended.  Adding a journal element to the bot would greatly help relieve stress from the life of hard-working students. The bot will be programmed to respond and ask prompting questions such as “how was your day?” and develop further through open ended questions like “how does that make you feel?” or “what could we do about it?”. I believe instilling trust onto a chatbot as opposed to a peer or parents will allow the teen to open-up more as it’s in a less intrusive environment and feels more natural. 


					</p>
					<p>
						The integration with school and teacher information is a key feature of the bot. Information such as relevant study material, student timetables, assessment and exam details and dates will be extremely important for the bot to hold on its servers so it can pull these upon student's request. Although a large side of this project is based on data in servers, the building and upkeep of these servers and the bot itself, another equally large side is a human based workforce side of not only teachers but also the school system to help input necessary information for their students.         
					</p>
					<p>
						The many aspects that go into this project require a variety of skills, hardware and a mix human input. The first aspect is the chat bot itself, there are already an abundance of prebuilt chat bot skeletons in existence on site such as ‘botmart.com’ but the upkeep and building will of course need to be done on preferably advanced Python skills as it is already the standard for many chat bot developers. Dedicated servers will be needed to store data and resources for the clients, also server maintenance and upkeep will be needed, so knowing a server-side language such as PHP or java will be necessary. Basic encryption will also be needed for the student log ins.    
					</p>
					<p>
						Hopefully the outcome of this development will positively impact the study life of many students. The end goal is to have students be not only more engaged in their studies by having a reliable and fun ‘study buddy’ but to also keep them on track with their academic achievements and goals. By making relevant resources for self-study accessible and provide emotional support, this will reduce anxiety about tackling topics in class and get rid of the dread of assignments. Overall, I believe this bot will improve the general wellbeing of the student and allow them to have more confidence and direction with their independent study. This in tow will hopefully produce higher, more engaged results across all faculties.
