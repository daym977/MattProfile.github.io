					<p>My interest in IT spans back to my childhood. Back in the day it was dial up internet and waiting 5 minutes for a simple image to load was truly painful.  <br><br>

						Much later I was introduced to two sites called YouTube and Newgrounds, the fact that I had access to limitless content truly shook my world and showed me all the potential for creativity and the countless types of platforms that awaited me. After finishing high school and a Cert III in business I found myself working in a small family owned retail store where one of my many duties was general IT. This showed me just how much I enjoyed IT as a source of work and started to pursue an education. <br><br> 

					I knew that an online course was optimal for my learning style and am very grateful to have these resources available to me through Open Universities and RMIT. Looking into RMIT as a university, I was impressed by how highly regarded it was within the IT industry and found the extensive support and services attached to online studying made it an easy transition into studying again.     </p>

						My main goal is for my study path to lead me into a fruitful career and just what career do I find myself looking for the most? Ethical hacking and security. This job found on Seek is just one example of the many Ethical hacking jobs being advertised every day. 
					</p>

					<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/41087333?type=standout#searchRequestToken=f2db07f9-2cf9-496a-a70a-67a8a079e8e3 " target=_blank>Job Link </a>
					<img src="JOB.png" alt="Job Description">
					<p>This job is for a Senior Penetration analysis and therefore comes with many responsibilities. The key aspects of the job are obviously helping ensure clients internet safety by not only helping with the upkeep of system already implemented by the company but also help integrate new systems into the company for the safety of the clients.<br> <br>  

						This job covers so many different areas of IT and therefor requires many skills and experience especially since it is a senior position. It is already a prerequisite to have at least 4 years in a similar position previous but to also hold a bachelor's degree in a relevant position. The actual skills that this job requires varies largely but the key ones are a solid understanding in programming languages such as Python, Ruby and JavaScript. The in-depth knowledge of the popular operating systems such as Microsoft and Linux alongside the knowledge of concepts in multiple security variations.  <br> <br>  

					Right now, my abilities are far from ready to tackle this job but that’s what goals are for. I only have a rather basic understanding of two programming languages (JavaScript and Python) and only a surface knowledge into what goes into cyber security. Not to mention my lack of leadership abilities at the current time. I’m looking forward to using my current degree to help build on all aspects of this and especially using the group work to help with building leadership qualities. I may even pursue a master's in cyber security if that’s what interests me later when I have finish by current degree. </p>

					<p>After undergoing three online personality test, I have done some reflection on what these results mean to me. The first test conducted was the iconic Myer Briggs <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/" target=_blank>test </a>. The results are in and my personality type has come back as INFJ-T, but what does this mean? Essentially this describes me as introverted, intuitive, feeling and judging strongly based on morals. Breaking this down it’s believed that INFJ people are meant to be introverted idealists with strong moral standards. I think this is a rather accurate reflection of my character of all the tests I took, as I have always been rather introverted and no matter the consequences I stick to what I believe is right.   </p>

					<img src="mind style.png" alt="Myer Briggs Personality">

					<p>The second test undertaken was the big five personality <a href="https://www.truity.com/personality-test/17315/test-results/16862546" target=_blank>test </a>. which breaks my score down into five dimensions of personality: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism. The breakdown is quite clear and heavily favours agreeableness and neuroticism. Both typically go hand in hand, the neuroticism tends to show people who hold themselves to strong morals and think strongly with their feelings and high agreeableness tends to mean that these people tend to help others rather than help themselves. These tests results are rather varied in accuracies, I can easily agree with the high agreeableness and high neuroticism and even the low extraversion, but the openness and conscientiousness should be far lower. </p>

					<img src="big5OCEAN.png" alt="Learning Style">

					<p>The last test I took was the learning styles <a href="http://www.emtrain.eu/learning-styles/" target=_blank>test </a>. This test developed based on the Honey and Mumford thought on study types. They believed there was four main learning types; Reflector, Theorist, Pragmatist and Activist. This test gave some rather all rounding results with low of activist and higher in reflector and theorist. A reflector is someone who takes their time to process information and makes decisions based on knowledge as opposed to making hasty or irrational choices.  The theorist is similar and approaches problems in a logical manner and value rationality and objectivity highly.   </p>

					<img src="learningStylesPieChart.png" alt="Learning Style">

					<p>These results display a clear personality of someone who is rather introverted and quiet, not because they are shy but because they’re standing back and processing the information around them. A person with these personality traits demonstrates the ability to work well with more outgoing, outspoken people as they’re willing to accept and discuss ideas rather than work with other introverted people who might be more reserved. </p>

					<h1>The Big Idea</h1>

				<div class="sectionContent ">

					
					<p>For my project, I wanted to target the lack of interaction students get outside of school and help foster independent study with more access to resources. The idea is to build a chat bot to act as the student’s personal assistant/mentor. With the school’s assistance, the bot will be able to help students by providing resources to cover all topics that are currently studying and aid with assignments or projects. The bot will also have a personalised element of setting study reminders to make it more engaging with the student. </p>
